# Matrix-and-multivariate-normal-mixtures

The MatVarMix_1.0.0.tar.gz R package fits mixtures of matrix-variate and multivariate normal distributions via EM-based algorithms.
EM-EM initializations are implemented for random starting values.
Ten common information criteria can be computed once the model is fitted to the data.
